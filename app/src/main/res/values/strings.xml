    <string name="shoppe_about">Shopping is an activity in which a customer browses the available goods or services presented by one or more retailers with the potential intent to purchase a suitable selection of them. A typology of shopper types has been developed by scholars which identifies one group of shoppers as recreational shoppers,[1] that is, those who enjoy shopping and view it as a leisure activity \n \n Online shopping has become a major disruptor in the retail industry[3] as consumers can now search for product information and place product orders across different regions. Online retailers deliver their products directly to the consumers' home, offices, or wherever they want. \n\n  <b> If you need help or you have any questions, feel free to contact me by email.</b> </string>
